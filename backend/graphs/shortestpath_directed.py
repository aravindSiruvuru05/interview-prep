# When to Use Which?
# Scenario	Use Algorithm
# DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)	Topological Sort (O(V + E))   -  efficieant for DAGs
# General Graph with non-negative weights	Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (O(E log V)) -- works for all directed undirected non negative but
# specially for directed graph topo method give beter time complexity as for evey node we are not rebalancing the nodes (happush (logN)) in pq in relaxation phase
# General Graph with negative weights	Bellman-Ford Algorithm (O(VE))
